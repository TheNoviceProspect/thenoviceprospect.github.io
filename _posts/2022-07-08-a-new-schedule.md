## Intro

As some may have noticed on my schedule, I have decided to change things about.
Satisfactory is now a pre-recorded series, and more importantly No Man's Sky is
now a stream that will be published twice a week.

I have also included a "campaign" based game, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla

## Full Explanation

Looking at my engagement numbers, it has become clear, that Satisfactory is not
worth doing since I really suck at being efficient :wink:

I have thus decided to put my "best" (in relative terms) series into the
spotlight, as it were.

Having reviewed one of my older series, I realized that doing another campaign-based
game might actually be beneficial as well, and since I only recently aquired AC: Valhalla
I thought I could kill 2 birds with one stone :smile:

## Final thoughts

In lack of actual viewer engagement I can only make decisions based on numbers provided
by Google/Youtube.

I do encourage viewer engagement, however, and if someone would like to see something,
that as been mentioned in a preview series/video, hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NoviceProspect)

Or leave a comment on my video(s)

peace out<br />
