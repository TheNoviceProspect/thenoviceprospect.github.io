Having finally recovered from 36 hours of no sleep, I just realized that I
totally forgot to stream No Man's Sky yesterday.  \

So, it looks like I will be recording 2 videos today,
one will be a live-stream for NMS, and then later on I will record this
weeks episode of TWEG (This Week's Epic Game).  \

Again, apologies for the missed video yesterday, it will get uploaded later on  \

peace out  \
Sebastian
