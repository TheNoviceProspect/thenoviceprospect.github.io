It's half past 4 and I'm running now on sheer grit!  \
 \

## .. or Premiere Pro is *really* hard

So I exported the video as h265 (hoping, against all hope, that the chapters would be included)  \
 \
**NOPE!**  \
 \
### So Plan B?
Export as Quicktime with chapters?  \
Takes double the render time, no NVIDIA acceleration :doh:  \
 \
### Plan C, please??
Export the chapters as csv, and tell HandBrake to import them?  \
`Unable to import chapter file: Line 1 is invalid. Nothing will be imported`
At this point I'm too tired to really look into it.  \

### So Plan D

Just compress, upload, and *hope* that YouTube accepts my chapters file...

## The finale (hopefully)

HandBrake is 90% done rendering from 19.5 to (probably) 5(ish) gigs.  \
Then it's upload time and see what YT makes of chapters file, if not **F$CK IT**, no chapters (for now)  \
 \
Again: thanks for your patience while i got this done.  \
 \
 peace out  \
 Sebastian
