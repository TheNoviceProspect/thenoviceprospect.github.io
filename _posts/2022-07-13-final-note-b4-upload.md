So it is now quarter to 3, and after another 750ml "cup" of coffee,
just now, **I AM DONE** with the editing.  \
(Thank f*ck)  \
 \

## A few words before I upload
.. while the video renders, and before I compress it with HandBrake  \
 \
First of all, Ive decided to scrap the captions (for this time),
the extra work, I would still have to put in, to sanitise them all would be
staggering, considering, that the footage is still an hour long, and my
enunciation is *terrible*.  \
 \
There's a few time-lapses, but nothing too taxing (I hope)  \
 \
I've also got a stream coming up in roughly 8 hours, and I would like to capture
some more time-lapse footage (as promised at the end of the episode),
and I plan to (hopefully) get 3 hrs sleep in there somewhere :smile:

## Time for a "Lessons learned"
- **E-NUN-CI-ATE**
- Keep your game-audio and mic-audio on seperate tracks in the raw footage
  - ie: forget StreamLabs for recording, it's awesome for streaming still!
- keep footage more organised when recording
  - *less butterfly*
  - **more hawk**
- Also; Premiere Pro is hard for novices :wink:

## Before I leave

Thanks for your patience while i got this done, I promise to get faster at this :smile:  \
 \
 peace out  \
 Sebastian
