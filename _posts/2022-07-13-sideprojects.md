## Sideprojects are my BANE!!

So it is now way past midnight, I've had a 750ml "cup" of coffee,
about half an hour ago and I'm _almost_ done with the editing.

But it wouldn't be this bad, if I didn't decide on 3 different side projects,
**DURING MY EDITING PROCESS**

***What the heck is wrong with me???*** :wink:


## Sideprojects? What Sideprojects???

### Sideproject 1 (The Search for a 3rd Screen)

.. now in widescreen, or so I thought..

turns out my DVI to VGA adapter is buggered, so no dice, well until Amazon delivers.



### Side Project 2 (The Search for the Laptop's Power)

This one was easy, except for me having wiped the laptops ssd, soooo ...



#### Side Project 2.5 (Linux Install)

- Find a distro I like, and maybe still have an ISO on my NAS???
- _Burn_ USB-stick with image
- Install and wait with more coffee

2 hours of my time well spent :grin:



### Side project 3 (Cleanliness is a nice feature in a B*ong)

What can I say, I like a clean B*ng for my 420 needs :smile:



### And who can forget Side Project 4

.. writing this blog post
